# ABSTRACT

Every day it is noticed that there is a great concern on the part of the population with the
reduction of spending on energy, due to the high tariffs charged by the utilities for the use of
this resource. Accompanying this need, this work is an experiment on how to use Internet of
Things devices to reduce energy spending by promoting the monitoring of its consumption. The
technologies applied address the reduction in energy consumption with the method of dimming
the lamps, controlling the amount of energy dissipated into the circuit. The experimental and
exploratory method is used, carrying the purpose of providing more familiarity with the
problem with the aid of the lighting standards listed in NBR ISO/CIE 8995-1, especially
involving the lighting conditions for each type of environment and activity, whose result
revealed to be possible the development of a low-cost solution that is capable of achieving
significant reduction in energy consumption..
